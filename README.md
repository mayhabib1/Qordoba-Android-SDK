# Intro to the Qordoba Android SDK


Qordoba's SDK enables agile, intelligent internationalization for native Android applications. Benefits of localizing via an SDK versus file-based methods include:

* Live renderings of your screens for your marketing and localization teams (no code required)
* Easy, dynamic maintenance of content in your app (without re-submitting to the App Store)
* Improved QA for your app, in less time
* Happy, engaged international users (since we all ***know*** when an app has not been well-localized)

* Android Studio ( 1.X.X or 2.0.0-BetaX )
